# Zowe Advocacy Council (ZAC)

## Roles and Responsibilities

The Zowe Advocacy Council (ZAC) is a two way communication and coordination team primarily, but not limited to, commercial exploiters of Zowe. This two way channel is for project requirements from commercial stake-holders and to assist in outbound messaging of Zowe to the z/OS ecosystem. The ZAC also manages new technology directions for the Zowe project via approving new sub-projects (i.e., incubator projects) and is an arbitor of any major issues needing resolution that impact the whole of the Zowe project.  

The ZAC works in cooperation with the Zowe Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Feedback is primarily to be sought for major project directions impacting cross squad activities such as: Re-versioning, infrastrucutre/tooling issues, defining and maintaining what is core Zowe technology and what is optional, community support policy issues, etc. Example roles and responsibilities for the ZAC include:

- Collect and summarize Zowe consumer feedback from customers, vendors, Independent Software Vendor (ISV), System Integrator interactions and any other 3rd parties.

## Membership

The ZAC consists of up to 9 voting members. 

One vote is assigned to the TSC. The TSC decides who their voting member is. The remaining 8 ZAC members will come from Open Mainframe Project Silver (or above) members. Members are nominated by any Zowe committer. No more than 2 individuals on the ZLC can be affiliated with the same company. The nominee must agree to be a candidate and to serve if elected. ZAC members should be willing to actively serve by attending weekly ZAC meetings and voting on ZAC issues for at least a one year term. ZAC members are voted on by the Zowe committers.    

The 8 seats are voted on yearly (typically Feburary) with the top 8 vote getters to serve. In the event there are not 8 nominees (or a nominee receices no votes) then the members with votes shall fill the seats and empty seats will exist. 

Empty seats can be filled at any time during the year. New OMP Silver (or above) members can be nominated by any existing ZAC members. ZAC members vote to fill an empty seat for the remainder of the 1 year term until the next February at-large vote on the ZAC members. Adding a new ZAC member to fill a vacant seat needs unanimous  agreement of the ZAC members. 

The ZAC will operate on a consensus basis in all decisions.  The roles on the ZLC (Chair, Vice or Secretary) are decided by the members of the ZLC.
