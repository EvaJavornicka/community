# Zowe 101 client side for users

If I finish this course I will be able to use the Zowe tools to perform typical mainframe operations without using tools such as TN3270, development of MF specific applications. I will be able to use the tools to e.g. automate the DevOps pipelines, carry IT Ops tasks and I will be aware of all the Zowe projects and their potential.
