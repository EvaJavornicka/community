# Build API ML Extension

If I finish this course I will be able to create a new API service that will be onboarded to the API ML and will be conformant. I will also understand the difference between services managed by Zowe and standalone services and understand that itâ€™s possible to extend API Mediation Layer directly. I will know where I can ask for help and how I can get involved in the Zowe.

**Involved squads:** API ML squad

**Personas:**

**Environments:** The Cloud environment is enough for the interactive version.
