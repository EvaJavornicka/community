# Zowe Server Side Installation and Operation

If I finish this course, I will be able to install and operate Zowe on the zOS side. I will understand what server side components exist, what configurations exist and which one I should use for specific scenarios. I will also be able to debug problems with the server side instances during the installation and operation. Security and the checklists need to be part of it to some extent. I expect to cover High Availability.
