# Zowe Containers Installation and Operation

If I finish this course, I will be able to install and operate Zowe using the containers and Kubernetes. I will understand what server side components exist, what configurations exist and which one I should use for specific scenarios. I will also be able to debug problems with the server side instances during the installation and operation. I will also understand what security requirements Zowe has and how to configure it for secure operations. The course contains the setup necessary for High Availability of Zowe itself.
