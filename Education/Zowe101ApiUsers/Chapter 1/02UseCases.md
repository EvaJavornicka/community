# Example Use Cases

## Banking in Europe

The PSD2 directive is a regulation that requires banks to open up their customer data and services to third-party providers via APIs. This has been a major factor in the development of banking APIs, as it has incentivised banks to make their customer data and services available through secure, standardized APIs, allowing third-party providers to access customer data and offer innovative services and products. By opening up customer data through APIs, banks are able to comply with the PSD2 directive while also enabling third-party providers to offer new financial services and products to their customers. 

A startup could use open banking APIs to provide customers with new ways to manage their finances. For example, a startup could use APIs to allow customers to easily transfer money between accounts, track spending, and receive personalized financial advice. Additionally, open banking APIs could be used to provide customers with access to a wide variety of financial products, such as loans and investments, as well as to provide customers with more detailed information about their accounts. By using open banking APIs, startups can offer customers a more convenient and secure way to manage their finances.

## Cloud Management

A company could use cloud providersâ€™ APIs to manage their production workloads by utilizing the availability, scalability, and security benefits that cloud computing provides. This could include creating and managing cloud-based virtual machines, scaling up or down the amount of compute resources needed to meet production workload demands, and setting up secure data backups and disaster recovery plans. Additionally, a company could use APIs to monitor their production workloads in real-time and receive automated alerts if issues arise. APIs can also be used to automate the deployment of new applications or services, as well as automate routine maintenance tasks such as software updates and patching

## Networking APIs

Network APIs allow applications to access and utilize network resources, such as creating a connection to a server, sending and receiving data, or performing other network-related activities. This makes it easier for developers to create applications that are capable of interacting with the network, as well as providing secure and reliable communication between networks. Network APIs can also be used to create complex network applications that are capable of managing large-scale networks with ease.

A network API might look like this:

GET /network/status

Retrieve the current status of the network.

POST /network/configure

Configure the network settings.

PUT /network/connect

Connect to a remote network.

DELETE /network/disconnect

Disconnect from a remote network.

## Healthcare

One example of an API used within healthcare is the Health Level Seven (HL7) API. This API is used to provide a secure and standardized way to exchange patient health data between systems, including Electronic Health Records (EHRs), billing systems, imaging systems, and other healthcare applications.
