# Example Use Cases

APIs are an essential part of almost every major industry. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the various ways these APIs are used in order to get a better understanding of what it means to be utilizing them.

## General

### Open Banking 

A startup could use open banking APIs to provide customers with new ways to manage their finances. For example, a startup could use APIs to allow customers to easily transfer money between accounts, track spending, and receive personalized financial advice. Additionally, open banking APIs could be used to provide customers with access to a wide variety of financial products, such as loans and investments, as well as to provide customers with more detailed information about their accounts. By using open banking APIs, startups can offer customers a more convenient and secure way to manage their finances.

The key role in the Europe with respect to the development of banking APIs played the PSD2 directive. It is a regulation that requires banks to open up their customer data and services to third-party providers via APIs. This has been a major factor in the development of banking APIs, as it has incentivised banks to make their customer data and services available through secure, standardized APIs, allowing third-party providers to access customer data and offer innovative services and products. By opening up customer data through APIs, banks are able to comply with the PSD2 directive while also enabling third-party providers to offer new financial services and products to their customers.

### Cloud Management

A company could use cloud providersâ€™ APIs to manage their production workloads by utilizing the availability, scalability, and security benefits that cloud computing provides. This could include creating and managing cloud-based virtual machines, scaling up or down the amount of compute resources needed to meet production workload demands, and setting up secure data backups and disaster recovery plans. Additionally, a company could use APIs to monitor their production workloads in real-time and receive automated alerts if issues arise. APIs can also be used to automate the deployment of new applications or services, as well as automate routine maintenance tasks such as software updates and patching

### Healthcare

One example of an API used within healthcare is the Health Level Seven (HL7) API. This API is used to provide a secure and standardized way to exchange patient health data between systems, including Electronic Health Records (EHRs), billing systems, imaging systems, and other healthcare applications.

### DevOps

The use of APIs in DevOps enables developers to integrate their code into the main branch of a project automatically and continuously. This process can be automated by using APIs in order to trigger builds, get notifications of build statuses, and deploy builds to production. This helps to ensure that the code is always up-to-date and that any changes are quickly and accurately tested and deployed.

## Mainframe

### DevOps

Endevor API applications ensure the safe building, integration and deployment of code into production. Risk assessment can also be done using tools like SonarCloud and the quality of JCLs can be checked with JCL Check.

### Observability

The API Mediation Layer within Zowe simplifies getting the information about the DB2 usage into the tools such as Grafana by supporting the client certificate authentication. There are also services such as Alert Central which integrates the data from multiple Rest APIs available on the z/OS platform.
