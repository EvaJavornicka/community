# What is API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications, and it specifies how software components should interact. APIs are becoming increasingly important in the current economy, as they allow businesses to create new products and services, facilitate data exchange between different systems and organizations, and provide access to valuable data sets. APIs are also driving the development of new technologies and applications, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. APIs are an essential part of the digital economy, enabling companies to stay competitive and build innovative new products.

The API economy refers to the business opportunities created by the use of APIs. APIs allow applications to communicate with each other and share data and services. The API economy is based on the idea that organizations can make money through the use of APIs by creating new services, increasing customer engagement, and improving operational efficiency. This can be done by selling access to APIs, selling data created by APIs, or developing applications that use APIs. .The API economy is a new way of thinking about business. Instead of trying to build an application from scratch, software developers can simply develop an API and allow consumers to connect with the information or service they offer. APIs allow for different organizations to innovate in different ways, making it possible for many companies to grow their business in a sustainable way. The API economy is already starting to see increasing profits for companies that are able to capitalize on this new phenomenon.

## Types of APIs from business point of view

1. Open APIs: Also known as Public APIs, these are freely available and accessible to the public and do not require authentication or authorization.

2. Partner APIs: These are APIs provided on an invitation basis to some selected partners for them to integrate into their applications.

3. Internal APIs: These are privately owned by an organization only for their internal use.

4. Composite APIs: These are a combination of several individual APIs that can be used together as a single API call in order to make several processes simpler for the end user.

### Open APIs

Open Traffic API is an example of an open API used in traffic management. This API provides real-time traffic data from over 500 cities around the world. It provides information such as current traffic speed, road closures, and traffic incidents.

### Partner APIs

The BBVA Open Platform is an example of a partner API used in banking. The platform provides access to a range of APIs, allowing developers to create innovative FinTech solutions using financial data from BBVA. The platform includes APIs for digital payments, customer insights, personal finance management, and account information services.

### Internal APIs

There are further types of internal APIs. 

1) Business APIs

2) Infrastructure APIs

Business APIs are APIs that allow a company's internal systems to interact with each other. These APIs allow data and services to be shared across different applications, databases, and systems, enabling businesses to streamline their processes, reduce costs and increase efficiency. Internal business APIs may be used for tasks such as data integration, data synchronization, process automation, and application integration. They enable companies to leverage their existing infrastructure and connect it with new applications and services.

Infrastructure API is an application programming interface (API) that provides access to the underlying technology and resources of an organization's internal infrastructure. This API enables developers to build applications that interact with the organization's internal systems, such as databases, networks, and operating systems. The internal infrastructure API allows organizations to control access to their internal resources and manage the security of their data. It also helps organizations create a consistent environment for building software applications.

An example of an internal API used for DevOps is a deployment API. This API allows developers to automate the process of deploying updates, patches, or other new features to a production environment. It provides a set of commands that can be used to control the deployment process, such as starting or stopping deployments, scheduling deployments, and monitoring progress. This API can help reduce the amount of manual work involved in deploying code, allowing developers to focus more on developing and testing code.

### Composite APIs

An example of a composite API is the Google Maps API. This API allows developers to create maps, add layers, and embed directions within web and mobile applications. It also provides a range of services including geocoding, geolocation, places, and directions.

From a technological point of view, there are various types of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be used to develop software applications. These include GraphQL, Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs and WebSocket-based APIs. Each type of API provides different functionalities which are tailored to meet the specific needs of the application under development. GraphQL for example is best suited for developing applications that require frequent updates, REST APIs provide an effective way to handle data requests and Websocket-based APIs offer real-time communication between two or more computers.

## Types of APIs from technological point of view:

1. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): A messaging protocol that allows programs that run on disparate operating systems (such as Windows and Linux) to communicate using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its Extensible Markup Language (XML). 

2. REST (Representational State Transfer): An architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. 

3. JSON-RPC: A remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. It is a very simple protocol (and very similar to XML-RPC), allowing for remote procedure calls over HTTP and HTTPS.The JSON-RPC is a very simple protocol allowing for remote procedure calls over HTTP and HTTPS. It is a very similar protocol to XML-RPC

4. GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 which provides an alternative to REST-based architectures and allows APIs to be more efficient and flexible. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need, and makes it easier to evolve APIs over time.

### SOAP

An example of using the SOAP API is to create a web service that allows a client to access data from a server. For example, a client may want to access employee information stored on the server. The client can use the SOAP API to make a request for that data, which is sent over HTTP and returns an XML-formatted response containing the requested information.

### REST

An example of using a REST API is when a web application wants to access and manipulate data from a server. For example, a client may make a GET request to retrieve a list of items from the server, or a POST request to add a new item to the list. Other common operations include PUT requests to update existing items, and DELETE requests to remove items.

### JSON-RPC

JSON-RPC API can be used for a variety of applications and services, such as authentication, data transfer, and remote procedure calls.

For example, a web service may offer a JSON-RPC API for a client application to authenticate with the web service. The client application would send a JSON-RPC request to the web service containing login credentials, and the web service would respond with authentication details.

### GraphQL

Facebook utilizes GraphQL to power its mobile apps, website, and other internal tools. GraphQL is a query language that allows developers to generate the exact data they need from a single endpoint, which makes it an ideal solution for Facebook's complex data architecture. GraphQL gives developers the ability to query for any data they need in a single request, rather than making multiple requests for different types of data. This makes it easier for developers to fetch the necessary data quickly and efficiently. Additionally, GraphQL's type system allows Facebook to ensure that only valid queries are sent to the server and that results are always returned in a consistent

## Documenting APIs

### Open API

Open API (formerly known as Swagger) is an open source software framework that allows developers to create interactive API documentation for their applications. It is designed to help developers quickly create and document APIs that can be used by other developers. Open API is based on the popular Swagger specification, which describes how APIs can be used and how they should be structured. Open API enables developers to provide comprehensive information about the APIs they are building, including how they interact with other components of the system. Open API also offers a way to test APIs, helping developers ensure their applications are working as expected.

### GraphQL

GraphQL documents the API by providing a comprehensive description of the data available from an API. It does this through a query language which can be used to request specific data from an API and provides a detailed description of the data structure, including fields, types and relationships. GraphQL also allows for the easy creation of documentation that is easy for both developers and non-developers to understand, making it a powerful tool for documenting APIs.
